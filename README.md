# Creative-Computing-Project
Fine Arts 205: creative computing. Developing a computer program that engages with ideas of computational arts. Following themes of digital folklore.  

I chose to engage with the theme of digital folklore as I was unsure what it really meant. With a bit of research I chose to use this theme and combined it with traditional folklore. Overall I would like to make the focus more on bringing traditional themes into the digital space whilst staying true to the core of what digital folklore is. 

For my final project I have decided to set up a webpage with a small index of folklore creatures. The user can choose which creature they want to see and upon selection it will load imagery not only related to that creature but also referencing popular online memes and media. 
as I built up this idea it sort of turned into more of an interactive page where the user can essentially make their of collage of folklore. I don't think this is bad but i'd prefer something a little more complex so will return to the drawing board on a better way to execute my idea.
