# Creative-Computing-Project
Fine Arts 205: creative computing. Developing a computer program that engages with ideas of computational arts. Following themes of digital folklore.  

I chose to engage with the theme of digital folklore as I was unsure what it really meant. With a bit of research I chose to use this theme and combined it with traditional folklore. Overall I would like to make the focus more on bringing traditional themes into the digital space whilst staying true to the core of what digital folklore is.

For my final project I have decided to set up a webpage with a small index of folklore creatures. The user can choose which creature they want to see and upon selection it will load imagery not only related to that creature but also referencing popular online memes and media.

I built up this idea it sort of turned into more of an interactive page where the user can essentially make their of collage of folklore. I don't think this is bad but I would like to bring in more imagery from my artist choice.

as I kept working on my code, it stopped loading, i'm not sure if this was my internet or my computer or the code? but it really haulted my progress
