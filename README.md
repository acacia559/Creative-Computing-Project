# Creative-Computing-Project
Fine Arts 205: creative computing. Developing a computer program that engages with ideas of computational arts. Following themes of digital folklore.  

I chose to engage with the theme of digital folklore as I was unsure what it really meant. With a bit of research I chose to use this theme and combined it with traditional folklore. Overall I would like to make the focus more on bringing traditional themes into the digital space whilst staying true to the core of what digital folklore is.

For my final project I have decided to set up a webpage with a small index of folklore creatures. The user can choose which creature they want to see and upon selection it will load imagery not only related to that creature but also referencing popular online memes and media.

I built up this idea but it sort of turned into more of an interactive page where the user can essentially make their of collage of folklore. I don't think this is bad but I would like to bring in more imagery from my artist choice.

as I kept working on my code, it stopped loading, i'm not sure if this was my internet or my computer or the code? but it really haulted my progress
it did turn out to be the code but since I have already decided to reformat my program I am just going to remove the taniwha and keep to three buttons and have them set up more like instagram.

I decided to reformat my program so that it closer resembled the layout of the Instagram app. I started by creating a background inspired by 'eroding memories' but kept the focal point to the centre like that of Instagram. The imagery is created from text and silhouettes of traditional folklore creatures that I am using in my program. I put this together in procreate on my ipad then added as the bg image.  I them resized all the images to be square and then placed them above thje buttons which I have also set up to be in the order of the like, comment and shared buttons.
