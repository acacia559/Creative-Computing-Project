# Creative-Computing-Project
Fine Arts 205: creative computing. Developing a computer program that engages with ideas of computational arts. Following themes of digital folklore.  

I chose to engage with the theme of digital folklore as I was unsure what it really meant. With a bit of research I chose to use this theme and combined it with traditional folklore. Overall I would like to make the focus more on bringing traditional themes into the digital space whilst staying true to the core of what digital folklore is.
